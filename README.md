# Basic mathematical principles behind machine learning

Hosted at [machinelearning.tadeaspetak.net](http://machinelearning.tadeaspetak.net).

This is a short visualization demo of the most basic mathematical
principles behind machine learning. I wrote it tu support my 15-minute
talk during a *competence day* at [Jayway](http://jayway.com) in March, 2016.
While it's not the most organised demo in the world, not to mention it's not
even close to being responsive or anything like that, it fulfills its purpose:
it **visualizes cost function** and **gradient descent** principles.

It's written in [isomorphic](http://isomorphic.net) [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I wanted
to give that a try and I am fairly happy with
the setup and results. I wrote the visualization itself in pure [d3](https://d3js.org/) which
was fun since I had never used the library before. It's pretty awesome.
